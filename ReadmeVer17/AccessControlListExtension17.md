# Access Control List extension 1.7
All ACL related definitions (rights and groups) are described in articles (security descriptors and group definitions) that belong to the new namespace ACL. The articles in this namespace are protected, only sysops and owners can access and modify them. This is done to provide maximum security and to make maintaining ACLs as simple as possible.
