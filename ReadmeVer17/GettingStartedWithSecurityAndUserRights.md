# Getting started with Security and User Rights

SMW+ comes with some preconfigured rights and this article explains the default settings and how to get started with the Access Control List 

## Introduction

After the installation of SMW+ there are some predefined user groups and rights. All rights with exception of the reading rights are denied, per default. 

## Prerequisites

Log in as "WikiSysop"

## Explantion of the default user groups and rights

When you go to the special page **Special:HaloACL** directly or over the menu **Administration > Access rights administration**, you can see under the tab **Manage groups** some predefined user groups: 
* Knowledge architect
* Knowledge consumer
* Knowledge provider
* bureaucrat
* sysop 

The user "WikiSysop" (namely you as an administrator) belongs to all this groups.
