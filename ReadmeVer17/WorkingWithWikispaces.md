# Working with wikispaces

In MediaWiki, articles can be organised into wiki spaces. A wiki space is a collection of articles that are related in some way, for example subpages like ProjectA/Requirement1. If you want to separate areas in your wiki for each team or project within your organisation, you can set up a different space for each team or project.
Note: use the tree-view on the right hand side to navigate in the user manuals.

When a new wiki space is created, the wiki automatically created the corresponding access group and a security descriptor (SD). The new group can be used in the new SD. There is one main article for the wiki space and all sub-pages belong to that space. Sub-pages get the access rights of the main article inherited by default.

Each wiki space has:

* a main article
* sub-pages
* security descriptor
* groups 

The Access Control List version 1.4 comes with the following new features which provide together:

* The automatic creation of security descriptors based on the category of an article
* The automatic creation of groups based on the category of an article
* Structure of automatically created groups
* Automatic protection of sub-pages 

[Protecting wiki spaces](ProtectingWikiSpaces.md)
This article describes how to configure wiki spaces so all the articles in this space (sub-pages) are automatically protected like the main article of the wiki space (super page).

[Protecting pages](ProtectingPages.md)
This article gives details on how to protect your pages.
