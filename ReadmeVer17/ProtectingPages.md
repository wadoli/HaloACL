# Protecting pages

This article gives details on how to protect your pages. 

## Introduction

The Access Control List extension is an extension which introduces powerful access control capability in the wiki. You can protect single articles, articles from certain categories or namespaces and values of semantic properties against unauthorized access. Access can be granted to single users or groups of users to fit to a user's custom needs.

## Prerequisites

* You have to be logged in
* Optionally you can [create an Access control list template](CreatingAStandardAccessControlList_ACL_.md) first 

## Protecting a page

* Click Edit.
* Click the Advanced access rights definition

**Note:** The name of your page will be filled in the text-box automatically.

* You can create an Access Control List (ACL) so as to protect a page of your choice e.g. my page. A page can be protected in two ways, namely:
    * By creating a right – this is done by clicking the Create right button
    * By adding a template – this is done by clicking the Add template button.
