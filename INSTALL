Updating the database
---------------------

The HaloACL extension requires some additional tables in the database that must
be added to the existing database schema. Existing data will not be modified.
Therefore change into the maintenance folder of the HaloACL extension and run the
setup script:
 cd /folder_to_mediawiki/extension/HaloACL/maintenance
 php HACL_Setup.php
 
Creating default groups with default rights
-------------------------------------------
 
After the database is updated you can, IF YOU WANT, create some default groups 
with default permissions:
 
Group                | Default permissions
---------------------------------------------
Knowledge consumer   | read
Knowledge provider   | read, edit, upload
Knowledge architect  | read, edit, manage, upload
sysop                | read, edit, manage, upload, administrate, technical
bureaucrat           | read, edit, manage, upload, administrate, technical

The user "WikiSysop" is the default member of these groups.

To create these defaults you have to execute the following on the command line:
 cd /folder_to_mediawiki/extension/HaloACL/maintenance
 php HACL_Setup.php --initDefaults
